Hey RITluggers!

Welcome to Week 12! This week, join RITlug to build your own Spy Pi, a DIY
Raspberry Pi project to watch over your house or apartment.


### Spy Pi workshop

Join RITlug this **Friday, Nov. 17th** at **4:00pm in GOL-2650** (large DB lab)
to learn more about Taylor's Spy Pi project!

Spy Pi is a simple DIY project you can make with a Raspberry Pi. Outfit any old
picture frame with a Raspberry Pi and webcam, and suddenly intruders will never
know what's coming! We'll walk through the assembly, configuration, and
installation so you can go home and make your own.



### tl;dr details

* **Day**: Friday, Nov. 17th, 2017
* **Time**: 4:00pm - 6:00pm
    * Talk begins around 4:30pm
